UnitFormat classes are responsible for converting units to and from String forms.
QuantityFormat classes do the same for Quantitys.
There is a large variety of classes available to encompass just about any format you might need; however the SimpleUnitFormat and SimpleQuantityFormat classes covers most cases for SI units.
Since SimpleQuantityFormat includes a SimpleUnitFormat to deal with the unit part is is convenient to only describe SimpleQuantityFormat.

SimpleUnitFormat can interpret unit symbols, compound units and SI prefixes.
For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/Examples.java[tag="simpleformat"]
----
