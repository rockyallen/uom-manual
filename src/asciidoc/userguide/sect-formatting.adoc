[[sect-formatting]]
== Formatting

[WARNING]
According to the Javadocs, the parser should be configurable for the number-unit separator and the multiple-radix separators, but I can't get it to work.
The default <number><space>[prefix]<unit> works OK, so this is all I will describe until I work out what is going on.

Formatting is an exact reversal of parsing.
See the previous table for examples.
