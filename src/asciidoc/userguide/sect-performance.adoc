== Performance

////
- Don't want to be negative, but my first attempt at converting a program in primitives changed 2 seconds run time to nearly 3 minutes.
Was interactive, now unusable.

- Need to benchmark all suggestions-don't want to cause people work then find it makes no difference.
////

The advantages of using dimensioned quantities come at a price in speed and storage space.
UOM has been reported as about 20 times slower than BigDecimal ({issue}/298[issue #298], {issue}299[issue #299]).

Some suggestions for improving speed:

**Avoid unnecessary object creation**

Define Units and frequently used constants just once:

[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/Examples.java[tag="constants"]
----

**Avoid unnecessary Unit conversion**

Use consistent units.
For long maths routines, this means creating or converting all quantities to consistent units first using `.to()`.

**Don't use Quantities (1)**

For some tasks, the UnitConverter class can be used to avoid the cost of creating multiple Quantitys (xref:sect-unitconverter[]).

**Don't use Quantities (2)**

In numerically intensive code, use Quantities only at the input and output of your routines, then use primitives to do the actual sums.

[source,java]
----
Quantity<Power> method(Quantity<Mass> q_input) {
  double q_internal = q_input.to(METRE).getValue().doubleValue(); 
  ...
  return getQuantity(d_result, WATT);
}

Some suggestions for reducing space:

**Wrap primitive arrays and collections** (memory)

If you have many quantities of the same Unit, you can save space by only storing the Unit once.
The following class is type-safe in that attempting to set a quantity that is not commensurable with the unit provided in the constructor will cause a run-time exception (+UnconvertibleException+).

.DimensionedVector.java
[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/DimensionedVector.java[tag="class"]
----

**Store Quantities as primitives** (serialisation)

Each instance of the +ThermometerSample+ class below serialises as 8 bytes, but keeps the type-safety of Quantity.

.ThermometerSample.java
[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/ThermometerSample.java[tag="class"]
