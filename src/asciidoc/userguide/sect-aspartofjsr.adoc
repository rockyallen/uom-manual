== {product} as part of JSR-365

////
- I was trying to avoid all the SPI stuff and just treat {product} as a library because it seems really complex and possibly difficult to set up.
But it may be the only way to do things like use other parsers and other systems of units.
In which case it may have to be moved up to the getting started section.
////

{product} is one implementation of JSR-365, and provides a comprehensive set of classes for dealing with SI units. 
However it does not provide non-SI units or complex formatting.
To get these facilities you can use the service provided interface contained in the JSR-365 core library.

For example, you can obtain other formatters by name:

[source, java]
----
// Get the service
FormatService formatService = ServiceProvider.current().getFormatService();

// Get the default formatter
QuantityFormat format = formatService.getQuantityFormat();

// Get a named formatter
QuantityFormat nsFormat = formatService.getQuantityFormat(“NumberSpace”);
----

TBD
