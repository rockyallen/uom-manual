== Predefined Units

////
- Discussion of built-in units; where they are, how to list them. 

- Are they in the spec or the implementation?

- SystemOfUnits what is is for?

- SI

- Imperial - where to get them if they are not provided

- Mixing units from different libraries

////

Normally you will use the predefined constants in the Units class explicitly:
See also table at xref:appendix-predefinedunits[].
If these are not enough, you can create derived units by various methods (xref:sect-creatingnewunits[]).

{product} does not contain Imperial or any other system of units.
However they are provided by other libraries and can be freely mixed with the ones in {product}, but this is beyond the scope of this document.
(very weak-links to how?)
