= Units of Measure: User Guide

////
- Very drafty. 
The list at the start of each chapter describes what is going to be in it, and will be removed eventually.

- Quantitys (class name) or quantities (normal english)?

- How to write units: with spaces, small spaces or middle dots?

- Should I include systems-quantity-2.0.2.jar? It is not properly part of this project.

- commensurable or commensurate?

- static imports?

- Possible bug: Dimension.getBaseDimensions() contains J, N, I. How are these base units?

For my info:

- Why aren't quantities comparable by default?

TODO:

- Make sure terminology is internally consistent and consistent with the JSR

- Web search for more hints
