= Units of Measure: User Guide

////
- Very drafty. 

- Quantitys (class name) or quantities (normal english)?

- How to write units: with spaces, small spaces or middle dots?

- Should I include systems-quantity-2.0.2.jar? It is not properly part of this project.

- commensurable or commensurate?

- static imports?

- *USER* guide: Try not to just duplicate the spec

- Possible bug: Dimension.getBaseDimensions() contains J, N, I. How are these base units?

- Possible error in javadocs for AbstractQuantity.equals():
"To compare quantities stated using different units or using different amount implementations the compareTo or equals(Quantity, epsilon, epsilonUnit) methods should be used."

For my info:

- Why aren't quantities comparable by default?

TODO:

- Make sure terminology is internally consistent and consistent with the JSR

- Web search for more hints

[WARNING]
I am creating this document as I learn {product} so it has many errors and misunderstandings.
For now, use it as only an example of Asciidoctor.

== Parsing and formatting

In JSR-265, the same class is responsible for both parsing and formatting, to maintain consistency.
But it is convenient to describe parsing and formatting separately.

`UnitFormat` classes are responsible for converting units to and from String forms.

`QuantityFormat` classes do the same for Quantitys.

`SimpleUnitFormat` and `SimpleQuantityFormat` are the easiest to access and most complete, so will be described here.
These provide formatters for SI units only.

For a description of the other formatters, see xref:appendix-spi[].
