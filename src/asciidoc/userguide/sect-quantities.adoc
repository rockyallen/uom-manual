== Quantitys

=== Basics

A Quantity has a value, units and dimensions with getter methods for them:

[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/Examples.java[tag="quantitygetters"]
----

The value is a Number, so the precision and length of the Quantity is defined by the Number class (Is this true? Expand on implications).

=== Creating Quantitys

The normal method to create a Quantity was illustrated above:

[source,java]
----
include::{basedir}/src/main/java/Minimal.java[tag="main"]
----

Because Quantitys are immutable, arithmetic operations and converters also result in new Quantity objects.

The other way to create quantities is by parsing Strings (xref:sect-parsing[]).
This is normally only used when reading external input.

- Any others?
