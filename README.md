# uom-manual

Possible contribution to UOM.

To make sure that the examples work and generate the appendices, run Examples.java. 

To run benchmarking, run uom.bm.Main.java

I have only tried this through NetBeans, but it is a plain maven project so should work from the command line.

Sample outputs are in the top level folder temporarily.

EXAMPLE ONLY

Contains many misunderstandings and errors!
